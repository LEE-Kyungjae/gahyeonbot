# GahyeonBot

[한국어](README.md) | [English](README.en.md)

GahyeonBot is a Java-based Discord bot that combines an AI work assistant, continuous voice conversations, music playback, scheduled voice-channel actions, and server utilities. In dedicated assistant channels, users can talk or type naturally without repeating slash commands.

## Features

- **AI agent**: Routes `/gahyeona` (`/가현아` in Korean) and regular messages in the dedicated text channel to the agent runtime.
- **Per-server assistant channels**: `/setup` (`/설정`) creates and binds dedicated text and voice channels.
- **Voice assistant**: Automatically joins the configured voice channel and responds through an STT → AI → TTS pipeline.
- **Turn detection**: TEN VAD and end-of-speech silence rules prevent API calls on every brief pause.
- **Conversation memory**: Preserves user and assistant message boundaries for follow-up requests.
- **Pluggable speech output**: Supports Voicebox, Edge TTS, and a generic HTTP custom-TTS contract with optional Edge fallback.
- **Music and voice-channel tools**: Playback, pause, skip, queue management, and scheduled leave actions.
- **Newsletters and moderation**: Subscription-based DMs and server-management commands.

## Assistant Setup

Run the setup command once as a server administrator:

```text
/setup
```

Discord displays the localized `/설정` name for Korean users. The command creates or restores the bot's dedicated text and voice channels.

- Regular messages in the assistant text channel behave like `/gahyeona`.
- Entering the assistant voice channel makes the bot join automatically.
- Use `/assistant action:start`, `stop`, or `status` for manual control. Korean clients display the localized `/비서` command.

### Voice pipeline

```text
Discord audio → TEN VAD → STT → AI agent/OpenRouter → TTS → Discord audio
```

A turn is finalized only after the configured minimum speech and continuous-silence conditions are met. Each finalized turn creates one streamed OpenRouter request.

## Technology

- Java 21 and Spring Boot 3
- JDA 5 and LavaPlayer
- PostgreSQL / H2 and Flyway
- OpenRouter-backed agent runtime
- TEN VAD and replaceable HTTP STT
- Voicebox, Edge TTS, and generic custom TTS
- Docker, GitHub Actions, and Blue/Green deployment

See the [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [agent runtime](docs/agent-runtime.md) documents for implementation details.

## Requirements

- Java 21
- The included Gradle Wrapper
- A Discord bot token and application ID
- An OpenRouter API key when AI features are enabled
- Spotify credentials when music integrations are enabled
- PostgreSQL in production
- Reachable STT and TTS services for voice conversations

## Main environment variables

### Core and AI

| `OPENROUTER_MODEL` | OpenRouter model ID |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | Spotify client ID |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Spotify client secret |

### STT and turn detection

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ASSISTANT_STT_ENABLED` | Enables speech recognition |
| `ASSISTANT_STT_BASE_URL` | STT server base URL |
| `ASSISTANT_STT_ENDPOINT` | Transcription endpoint path |
| `ASSISTANT_STT_API_KEY_REQUIRED` | Whether STT authentication is required |
| `ASSISTANT_STT_API_KEY` | STT API key |
| `ASSISTANT_STT_MODEL` | STT model name |
| `ASSISTANT_VAD_ENABLED` | Enables TEN VAD |
| `ASSISTANT_VAD_THRESHOLD` | Speech probability threshold |
| `ASSISTANT_VAD_END_SILENCE_MILLIS` | Continuous silence required to finalize a turn |

### TTS

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `TTS_PROVIDER` | `voicebox`, `edge`, or `custom` |
| `TTS_FALLBACK_TO_EDGE` | Uses Edge when the primary provider fails |
| `VOICEBOX_BASE_URL` | Voicebox server URL |
| `VOICEBOX_PROFILE_ID` | Voicebox profile ID |
| `VOICEBOX_PROFILE_NAME` | Profile name fallback when no ID is configured |
| `VOICEBOX_MODEL_SIZE` | Voicebox model size |
| `VOICEBOX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Voicebox request timeout |
| `CUSTOM_TTS_ENDPOINT` | Custom synthesis HTTP endpoint |
| `CUSTOM_TTS_API_KEY` | Optional custom-TTS bearer token |
| `CUSTOM_TTS_MODEL` | Model alias understood by the inference server |
| `CUSTOM_TTS_SPEAKER_ID` | Speaker ID understood by the inference server |
| `CUSTOM_TTS_FORMAT` | `wav` or `mp3` |

See [Custom Voice TTS](docs/CUSTOM_VOICE_TTS.md) for the full HTTP contract. Never commit secrets to the repository or bake them into images; inject them through environment variables or GitHub Actions Secrets.

## Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LEE-Kyungjae/gahyeonbot.git
cd gahyeonbot
./gradlew clean test
./gradlew bootRun
```

To start the application without connecting to Discord:

```bash
BOT_ENABLED=false ./gradlew bootRun
```

The default development profile uses an in-memory H2 database when no external database is configured. Set the relevant `POSTGRES_DEV_*` variables and `FLYWAY_ENABLED=true` to use PostgreSQL.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t gahyeonbot:latest .
docker run --rm \
  -e TOKEN \
  -e APPLICATION_ID \
  -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY \
  gahyeonbot:latest
```

Inside a container, `127.0.0.1` refers to the container itself. Configure a container-reachable address when STT, Voicebox, or custom TTS runs on another host.

## Custom-voice research status

- **Voicebox**: Supports cloned-voice profiles built from recordings.
- **Piper distillation**: Experimental tools under `scripts/` distill Voicebox teacher audio into a lightweight Piper model. This is research work and is not treated as the default Discord TTS.
- Confirm speaker consent and audio usage rights, and protect recordings, models, and profile identifiers as sensitive data.

## Test and deploy

```bash
./gradlew clean test
./gradlew clean shadowJar
```

GitHub Actions tests pull requests and pushes to `main`, builds versioned images, and performs approved Blue/Green deployments. See [Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for details.
